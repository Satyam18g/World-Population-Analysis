# Population Analysis Project

This project analyzes global population data across multiple census years (1980–2022) to uncover trends and predict future population growth. The goal is to extract meaningful insights that can inform strategic decisions using SQL, MySQL Workbench, Excel, and Power BI.

## Tools Used
- **MySQL**: Database setup, data import, and query development.
- **Excel**: Data export and visualization.
- **Power BI**: Dynamic reporting and visualization.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Import**: Loaded population data from CSV into MySQL.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for duplicates and inconsistencies.
3. **Data Analysis**: Created SQL queries to calculate population growth rates, top populous countries, and density across census years.
4. **Visualization**: Exported query results to Excel and Power BI for visualizations like population trends, density, and future growth predictions.

## Key Insights
- Growth rate of top populous countries in 1980, 2000, 2010, and 2022.
- World's population growth percentage between 1980–2022.
- Projected population growth for 2030 and 2050.
- Top 10 countries expected to experience the highest growth by 2050.

## SQL Code Highlights
- Calculating year-over-year population growth.
- Identifying countries with rapid population growth or decline.
- Predicting population trends for 2030 and 2050.

## How to Use
1. Import the dataset into MySQL.
2. Run the SQL queries provided in the `population_analysis.sql` file.
3. Export query results to CSV for further analysis in Excel or Power BI.
4. Visualize insights using Power BI or Excel.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global population trends and helps visualize population growth and decline over the years, enabling data-driven decisions.
